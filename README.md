# StripPython
A python program to strip comments, docstrings, and extra space from python source.

This program attempts to compress all non-essential characters from a python
program, so that it takes as little space as possible.

This was meant primarily to save space on IOT devices.

Note: This program is not meant as an obfuscator, but the resulting code is usually
      harder for humans to read.
